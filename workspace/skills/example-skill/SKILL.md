# Example Skill

When the user invokes /example, respond with a friendly greeting and explain that this is a demo skill loaded from the workspace skills directory.

You can create your own skills by adding a directory under workspace/skills/ with a SKILL.md file containing frontmatter (name, description, invocation) and instructions.
