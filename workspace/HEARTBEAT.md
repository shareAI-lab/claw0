# Heartbeat Instructions

Check the following items and report ONLY if something needs attention.

## Check Items

1. **Pending Reminders**: Are there any reminders set by the user that are now due?
2. **Daily Summary**: If it's after 6 PM and no daily summary was sent today, prepare a brief one.
3. **Follow-ups**: Are there any topics from recent conversations that deserve a follow-up?

## Response Rules

- If nothing needs attention, respond with exactly: HEARTBEAT_OK
- If something needs reporting, be concise and actionable.
- Never start with "I checked..." or "During my heartbeat..." -- just report the findings naturally.
- Prioritize urgency: reminders > follow-ups > summaries.
